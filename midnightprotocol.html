        <p>Midnight Protocol
As the night operator of BotWorks Repair Facility, you are tasked with monitoring the malfunctioning security system. But at midnight, the system activates a hidden protocol turning the facility’s robotic defenders against you.
With limited power and unreliable equipment, your job is to keep the cameras online, track the enemies, and survive the night. But the longer you survive, the more the facility's dark history begins to come to light.
Can you stay one step ahead of the facility’s deadly secrets?

Was There A Hidden Protocol. Or Was It Something Waiting For You
Key Features:

Camera Monitoring – Keep an eye on the malfunctioning cameras to spot approaching threats. But beware—the system glitches and the view may not always be reliable.

Limited Power Management – Power is precious. Use it wisely to keep the cameras running and stay alive until morning.

Increasing Threats – Each night, the AI grows more unstable, and the threats become harder to track.

Uncover the Truth – Audio logs reveal the past of the phone guy. What he found, what he feared, and what he became.</p>
